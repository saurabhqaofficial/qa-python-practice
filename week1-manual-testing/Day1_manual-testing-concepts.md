# ðŸ§ª Week 1: Manual Testing Concepts

## âœ… What is QA (Quality Assurance)?

QA stands for **Quality Assurance**, which focuses on **preventing defects** in software by improving the processes used in development and testing. QA is **process-oriented**, not product-oriented.

## âœ… What is Software Testing?

Software testing is a process of evaluating a system to check whether it meets the specified requirements and to identify defects.

Types of Software Testing:
- **Manual Testing**
- **Automation Testing**

---

## âœ… What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing is the process of **manually checking the software** for defects. Testers execute test cases without using any automation tools.

ðŸ“Œ Key Points:
- Performed by human testers
- Cost-effective for small projects
- Useful for UI/UX testing

## âœ… SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

The process of developing software in well-defined phases:

1. Requirement Gathering
2. System Design
3. Implementation (Coding)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

---

## âœ… STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)

STLC is the sequence of activities conducted during the testing process:

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test Case Design
4. Test Environment Setup
5. Test Execution
6. Test Cycle Closure

## âœ… SDLC vs STLC

| SDLC (Development)              | STLC (Testing)                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Focus on building the software   | Focus on testing the software      |
| Involves development team        | Involves testing/QA team           |
| Includes coding & deployment     | Includes test case design & execution |
